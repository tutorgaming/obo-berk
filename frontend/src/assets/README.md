The logo will be displayed in the header next to the "OBO-Berk (โอโบ-เบิก)" heading.

### Recommended Logo Specifications

- **Size**: 40-60px height
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square or horizontal (1:1 or 16:9)
- **File Size**: Keep under 100KB for optimal loading

### How to Add Your Logo

2. The application will automatically detect and display it
3. If no logo is found, the heading will display without an image
